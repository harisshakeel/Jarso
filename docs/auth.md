# Authentication & authorization

Supabase Auth with cookie sessions via `@supabase/ssr`.

## Layers

| Layer | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proxy | `src/proxy.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/proxy.ts` | Refreshes the session cookie on every request. **Optimistic** redirects: signed-out → `/login?next=…` for `protectedRoutePrefixes`; signed-in → `/dashboard` for auth pages. |
| DAL | `src/features/auth/server/session.ts` | `getCurrentUser()` verifies the JWT (`getClaims`) and returns a narrow `SessionUser`. `requireUser(path)` for pages (redirects to `/login?next=<path>`), `assertUser()` for actions/APIs (throws 401). Memoised per request. |
| RLS | `supabase/migrations/*` | Final authority. Even a bug in app code cannot read another user's rows. |

**Proxy is not security.** Every page, action and route handler that touches user data must call `requireUser()` / `assertUser()`.

## Rules

- Never trust `getSession()` on the server — it doesn't verify the JWT. Use `getCurrentUser()`.
- Don't add code between `createServerClient` and `getClaims()` in the proxy.
- When returning a different response from the proxy, use `redirectWithSession` so refreshed cookies + cache headers are kept.
- Session reads are request-time → render inside `<Suspense>`.
- Post-login redirects go through `safeNextPath()` (blocks open redirects).
- Expose only `SessionUser` to the client, never raw claims.
- Protect a new area by adding its prefix to `protectedRoutePrefixes` in `src/config/site.ts` **and** calling `requireUser(routes.<page>)` in its pages.

## Flows

- **Email + password:** `signIn` / `signUp` Server Actions in `src/features/auth/server/actions.ts`.
- **Email confirmation / OAuth:** Supabase redirects to `/auth/callback?code=…`, which exchanges the code for a session. Allowed redirect URLs live in `supabase/config.toml` (`additional_redirect_urls`) and the hosted project's Auth settings.
- **Sign-out:** `signOut` Server Action.

## Adding OAuth providers

Enable in `supabase/config.toml` (`[auth.external.<provider>]`) and the dashboard, then call `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider, options: { redirectTo: <APP_URL>/auth/callback } })` from a client component.
